> The time complexity of prediction in logistic regression is O(NK^2).               
<!-- K^2 = K*K -->
> The space complecity of prediction in logistic regression is O(NK).
> The time complexity of training in logistic regression is O(KN^2).
<!-- N^2 = N*N -->
> The space complexit of training in logistic regression is O(NK + N + K).
